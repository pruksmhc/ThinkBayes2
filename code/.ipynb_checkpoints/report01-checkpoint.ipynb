    "A group of four friends are about to take a major international math competition exam similar to the IMO but which is made up of one multiple choice question in mathematics. They pass by a room and see the Head of Examination for their school discuss the answer. Simon says he overheard the Head saying the answer is A and thinks it is the answer. The friends, since they love math, decided to do an analysis. The distribution of answers in the past are as below:\n",
    "A: 35% \n",
    "B: 19% \n",
    "C: 20% \n",
    "D: 36% \n",
    "Given that Simon was telling the truth  (in that he indeed heard A), and human hearing at age 18 (Simonâ€™s age) is inaccurate 0.24 of the time, what is the probability that the answer is indeed A? \n"

    "Explanation: The prior is stated as above. The original question is : given Simon heard A, what is the probaiblity that the answer is indeed A? To answer this question, H is the event that the answer is indeed A, and D is the event that P(H1) = 0.35, where H1 is the answer is indeed A. P(H2) = 0.65, where H2 is that the answer is not A. The likelihood, or P(D|H1) = (0.35)(0.76), and P(D|H2) = (0.65)(0.24). Thus, by adding the two likelihoods and finding the probability, the probability of the answer to the exam being indeed A is 0.63. "
