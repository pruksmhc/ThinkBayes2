    "Two identical twins are members of my chess club, but they never show up on the same day; in fact, they strictly alternate the days they show up.  I can't tell them apart except that one is a better player than the other:  Avery beats me 60% of the time and I beat Blake 70% of the time.  If I play one twin on Monday and win, and the other twin on Tuesday and lose, which twin did I play on which day?"
